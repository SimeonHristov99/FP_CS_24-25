The depth of an atom *x* in a list *xs*
is the number of times *car* must be applied
to *xs* in order to reach *x*.
Define a procedure that removes all atoms that are smaller than their depth.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.
|#

(define (deep-delete xss)
  42
  )

; can reach "1" by applying "car" one time and "2" can be reached with "caadr".
(equal? (deep-delete '(1 (2 (2 4) 1) 0 (3 (1)))) '(1 (2 (4)) (3 ())))
(equal? (deep-delete '(3 ((1)) 1 ((((3)) 2) 42) 3 (6) 1 0 (3 1 (((9))) 0))) '(3 (()) 1 (((())) 42) 3 (6) 1 (3 (((9))))))
