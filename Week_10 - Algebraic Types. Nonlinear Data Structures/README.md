# üéØ Goals for week 10

1. Introduce the concept of **algebraic data types**.
2. Practice working with **graphs**.
3. Practice writing high quality code:
   1. Easy to read.
   2. Safe from bugs.
   3. Ready for change.

> üóø **Legend**: ‚≠ê - Easy | üåü - Medium | üí´ - Hard

## Solving in teams today

As we did last time:

1. Split in teams of at least `2` people.
2. Start solving the tasks on `1` computer.
3. When you are done with one task, call me for feedback. One of you will have to explain the solution.
4. Only then move on to the next task.
5. Iterate. Whichever team is done with all tasks is free to leave the class.
6. Solutions will be uploaded `5` minutes before the end of the session.

## üåü Task 1

**Description:**

Given a directed graph *g* with edges `[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)]` define the following functions:

1. nodes - returns all the nodes of "g";
2. neighbors - accepts a node and returns its neighbors;
3. adjacencyList - returns the children of every parent.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.
2. Appropriate types are created for the graph structure.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ nodes [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)] == [1, 2, 3, 4]

print $ neighbors 2 [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)] == [3, 4]
print $ neighbors 4 [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)] == []

print $ adjacencyList [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)] == [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])]
```

## üåü Task 2

**Description:**

Define a function that checks whether a given path is valid in a graph `g = (1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ isPath [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] [1, 2, 4] == True
print $ isPath [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] [1, 3, 4] == False
print $ isPath [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] [2, 3] == True
print $ isPath [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] [3, 1] == False
```

## üåü Task 3

**Description:**

Define a new data type called `Shape`. `Shape` must have four constructors:

- `Circle`: with one argument representing the radius;
- `Rectangle`: with two arguments representing the width and height;
- `Triangle`;
- `Cylinder` with two arguments for the radius of the base and height.

Create a shape from every type and output it.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. `Shape` is a `new` data type in Haskell.
2. Appropriate tests are added that demonstrate what the typeclass `Show` allows.
3. Appropriate tests are added that demonstrate what the typeclass `Eq` allows.
4. Appropriate tests are added that demonstrate what the typeclass `Read` allows.
5. Appropriate tests are added that demonstrate what the typeclass `Ord` allows.

## ‚≠ê Task 4

**Description:**

Create a new data type called `Point2D` and define a function that accepts two functions: `f` and `g` and a list of points with two coordinates. The function should return those points for which `f(firstCoordinate) = g(secondCoordinate)` and should be able to work with whole as well as floating point numbers!

Define an analogous function - `myImagesFold`, that implements the above logic using folding.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.
2. `Point2D` is a new data type in Haskell.
3. `myImagesFold` is implemented using folding.

**Test case:**

```haskell
print $ myImages (\x -> x * x) (2+) [Point 2 2, Point 1 2, Point 3 7] == [Point 2 2, Point 3 7]
print $ myImagesFold (\x -> x * x) (2+) [Point 2 2, Point 1 2, Point 3 7] == [Point 2 2, Point 3 7]
```

## ‚≠ê Task 5

**Description:**

By using the `Shape` data type, define the following functions:

1. isRound - returns whether a shape has a round side;
2. is2D - returns whether a shape has two dimensions.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ isRound (Circle 5) == True
print $ isRound (Rectangle 2.5 4.5) == False
print $ isRound (Rectangle 5.5 20.6) == False
print $ isRound (Triangle 5.3 3.9 4.89) == False
print $ isRound (Cylinder 20 30) == True

print $ is2D (Circle 5) == True
print $ is2D (Rectangle 2.5 4.5) == True
print $ is2D (Rectangle 5.5 20.6) == True
print $ is2D (Triangle 5.3 3.9 4.89) == True
print $ is2D (Cylinder 20 30) == False
```

## For home

### üí´ Task 1

**Description:**

Define a function that accepts a graph, a whole number `k` and a node `n`. Return all the paths starting from `n` that are `k` nodes long. If the node is not present, throw an error.

Use the following types:

```haskell
type Node = Int
type Graph = [(Node, [Node])]
type Path = [Node]
```

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ simplePaths [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 0 1 == [[1]]
print $ simplePaths [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 1 1 == [[1, 2], [1, 3]]
print $ simplePaths [(1, [2, 3, 4]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 1 1 == [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]

### ‚≠ê Task 2

**Description:**

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.

**Test cases:**

```haskell

print $ listLeaves [(1, 2, 3), (2, 4, 5)] == [4, 3, 5]
print $ listLeaves [(2, 4, 5), (1, 2, 3)] == [4, 5, 3]
