{-
Create a new data type called `Point2D`
and define a function
that accepts two functions: `f` and `g` and a list of points
with two coordinates. The function should return
those points for which `f(firstCoordinate) = g(secondCoordinate)`
and should be able to work with whole
as well as floating point numbers!

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.
2. `Point2D` is a new data type in Haskell.
3. Create `myImagesFold` using folding.
