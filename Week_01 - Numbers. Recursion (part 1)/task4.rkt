The first few numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ...` and so on.
Define two functions `fib-rec` and `fib-iter` that return the number at the $i^{th}$ index.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.
2. Parameter validation is performed.
3. `fib-rec` creates a linearly recursive process.
4. `fib-iter` creates a linearly iterative process.
5. Demonstrate the difference in execution time between iterative and recursive processes.
