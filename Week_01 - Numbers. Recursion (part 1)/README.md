### üì¢ Advice

The tasks have the sole purpose of helping you understand the material better and faster. Therefore:

1. Avoid using external tools or help for solving the tasks.
2. Drop us an email with your question/problem when you have difficulties.
3. If you can't solve a task:
   1. Spend at least 30 minutes trying out different ways to achieve what you want - maybe try to break down the task into smaller tasks and create functions that solve them.
   2. Solving a task manually with pen and paper will help you break it down into smaller tasks.
   3. If the above points don't help, it's best to reach out to us, skip this task and continue with the others. This would allow you to continue solving, while you're waiting for feedback from us.
4. If you are struggling a lot with the tasks, don't hesitate to ask us for a `1-1 session` in-person or via Google Meet üòá!

(equal? (even-if? 15452) "Yes")
(equal? (even-if? 321) "No")

(equal? (even-guards? 2) "Yes")
(equal? (even-guards? 15452) "Yes")
(equal? (even-guards? 321) "No")
```

### ‚≠ê Task 3

**Description:**

Define two functions - `sum-cubes-pow` and `sum-cubes-no-pow`, that return the sum of the cubes of two whole numbers.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case for each of the functions. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.
3. `sum-cubes-pow` is defined using the built-in power procedure.
4. `sum-cubes-no-pow` is defined without using the built-in power procedure.

(= (sq-avg 10 13) 134.5)
```

### üåü Task 5

**Description:**

The greatest common divisor (`GCD`) of two or more numbers is the greatest common factor that divides them, exactly. For example, the greatest common factor of `15` and `10` is `5`, since both the numbers can be divided by `5` and there is no number larger than `5` that divides `15` and `10`, thus `GCD(15, 10) = 5`.

One way to find the greatest common divisor between two numbers - `x` and `y` is by using `The Euclidean Algorithm`.

```text
The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(x,y) is as follows:
If x = 0 then GCD(x,y)=y.
If y = 0 then GCD(x,y)=x.
Write x in quotient remainder form (x = A‚ãÖy + R). Find GCD(y,R) (since GCD(x,y)=GCD(y,R)).
```

Define a procedure for calculating the `GCD` of two whole numbers.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.
3. Normally, you would use the built-in function `gcd`. This is the only time when you should **not** use it.
4. Guards are used for the implementation.

**Test cases:**

```scheme
(= (my-gcd 5 13) 1)
(= (my-gcd 13 1235) 13)
```

### ‚≠ê Task 6

**Description:**

A leap year is a calendar year that contains an additional day compared to a common year. The 366th day is added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year.

There are two mathematically equivalent methods for checking whether a year is a leap year.

```text
Method I: A year is leap year if it is a multiple of 400 or it is a multiple of 4 but not of 100.

Method II:
    if year is divisible by 400 then is_leap_year
    else if year is divisible by 100 then not_leap_year
    else if year is divisible by 4 then is_leap_year
    else not_leap_year 
```

Define two predicates - `leap-year-one-line?` and `leap-year-guards?`, that check whether a year is a leap year.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.
3. Parameter validation is performed only in `leap-year-guards?`.
4. Parameter validation is not performed in `leap-year-one-line?`.
5. `leap-year-one-line?` implements `Method I`.
6. `leap-year-one-line?` uses boolean logical operators.
7. `leap-year-one-line?` does not return `#t` or `#f` explicitly.
8. `leap-year-guards?` uses guards.

**Test cases:**

```scheme
(equal? (leap-year-one-line? 2020) #t)
(equal? (leap-year-one-line? 1988) #t)
(equal? (leap-year-one-line? 1600) #t)
(equal? (leap-year-one-line? 2400) #t)
(equal? (leap-year-one-line? 2023) #f)
(equal? (leap-year-one-line? 1700) #f)
(equal? (leap-year-one-line? 1800) #f)
(equal? (leap-year-one-line? 2100) #f)

(equal? (leap-year-guards? 2020) #t)
(equal? (leap-year-guards? 1988) #t)
(equal? (leap-year-guards? 1600) #t)
(equal? (leap-year-guards? 2400) #t)
(equal? (leap-year-guards? 2023) #f)
(equal? (leap-year-guards? 1700) #f)
(equal? (leap-year-guards? 1800) #f)
(equal? (leap-year-guards? 2100) #f)
```

### ‚≠ê Task 7

**Description:**

John has a backpack. With it he can carry `k` kilograms. An item from the supermarket weighs `w` kilograms. Define a procedure that accepts three numbers - `c` (number of products), `k` and `w` and returns whether John is capable of buying all the products in one trip to the supermarket.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.
3. Guards are used.
4. Parameter validation is performed.
5. The parameters are named in accordance with the names given in the description.

**Test cases:**

```scheme
(equal? (can-carry? 5 15 3) #t)
(equal? (can-carry? 1 5 4) #t)
(equal? (can-carry? 13 25 2) #f)
(equal? (can-carry? 24 104.44 21.12) #f)
(equal? (can-carry? 51 34.75 19.852) #f)
(equal? (can-carry? 42 95.11 0.51) #t)
```

### üåü Task 8

**Description:**

Each **day** a plant is growing by *up-speed* meters. Each **night** that plant's height decreases by *down-speed* meters due to the lack of sunlight. Initially, plant is `0` meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant will reach a certain level.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.
3. The parameters are named in accordance with the names given in the fourth test case.

**Test cases:**

```scheme
(= (growing-plant 5 2 5) 1)
(= (growing-plant 5 2 6) 2)
(= (growing-plant 10 9 4) 1)
(= (growing-plant 100 10 910) 10) ; up-speed=100, down-speed=10, desired-height=910
```

Explanations:

- for `up-speed = 10`, `down-speed = 9` and `desired-height = 4`, the output should be `1`.

```text
Because the plant reaches the desired height at day 1 (10 meters).
After day 1 --> 10
```

- for `up-speed = 100`, `down-speed = 10` and `desired-height = 910`, the output should be `10`.

```text
After day 1   --> 100
After night 1 --> 90
After day 2   --> 190
After night 2 --> 180
After day 3   --> 280
After night 3 --> 270
After day 4   --> 370
After night 4 --> 360
After day 5   --> 460
After night 5 --> 450
After day 6   --> 550
After night 6 --> 540
After day 7   --> 640
After night 7 --> 630
After day 8   --> 730
After night 8 --> 720
After day 9   --> 820
After night 9 --> 810
After day 10  --> 910
```

### üåü Task 9

**Description:**

A snail crawls up a column. During the day it crawls up some distance. During the night it sleeps, so it slides down for some distance (less than it crawls up during the day).

Your function accepts three parameters:

- The height of the column (meters);
- The distance that the snail crawls during the day (meters);
- The distance that the snail slides down during the night (meters).

Calculate the number of days the snail will need to reach the top of the column.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.

**Test cases:**

```scheme
(= (snail 3 2 1) 2)
(= (snail 10 3 1) 5)
(= (snail 10 3 2) 8)
(= (snail 100 20 5) 7)
(= (snail 5 10 3) 1)
```
