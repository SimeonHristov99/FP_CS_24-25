# Week_01 - Recursion (part 1)
###################################################################################################

[ ] If you don't have access to Moodle, write me an email as soon as possible: s.e.hristov99@gmail.com .
[ ] Walk around the GitHub page.
    [ ] What is that "For Home" section? (please remind Simo to explain it at the start of the second hour, in case he forgets!!)
[ ] Yes, homework 3 is going to be during the Christmas holidays.
    Here is a timeline that might change:
        - homework 1: 19.10.2024 - 03.11.2024
        - exam 1    : 09/10.11.2024
        - homework 2: 23.11.2024 - 10.12.2024
        - homework 3: 14.12.2024 - 05.01.2025
        - exam 2    : 11/12.01.2024
[ ] During the intermission create a chat in Facebook (FP_CS_24_25). Remind Simo if he forgets, please 😄!
    Also keep in mind that if you want a fast/timely reply, you ought to send an email.
    I do not log into FB often.


- !! bracket overflow 😄 !!
- Racket is PREFIX, i.e. first write the procedure and then write its arguments
- extension for Racket files: .rkt
- Edit > Preferences > Editing > Racket > put ticks everywhere
- Edit > Preferences > Editing > General Editing > Enable automatic parenthesis, square brackets, and quotes
- Shortcuts
    - `Cntr + Up-arrow` (or `Esc + p`) for using the previous input in interpreter window
    - `F5` (or `Cntr + F5`) for running the code in the text editor window
    - `Enter` to run code in the interpreter with caret after last character
    - `Cntr + Enter` to run code in the interpreter without caret after last character
    - the two windows are independent, so feel free to test code in the interpreter window even if the code in the text editor window has errors or is incomplete
- IMPORTANT NOTE: DrRacket DOES NOT autosave.

The functions in Racket are (formally) called procedures
    What is the difference between a procedure and a method?
        ???


What is a predicate?
    ???


Types of Evaluation Processes
   Linearly Recursive
        1. The result is stored in a recursive tail.
        2. The recursive call is part of an expression.

   Linearly Iterative
        1. The result is stored as a variable that is set by ANOTHER function.
        Often the variable is named "result" and the function - "helper".
        2. The recursive call is not part of an expression.
        These processes are faster than the linearly recursive ones!


What is a declaration and what is a definition?
    int add(const int x, const int y)       <-- ???
    {                                       <-- ???
        return x + y;                       <-- ???
    }                                       <-- ???


Built-in data types
    - boolean: #t #f
    - numbers: 1, 1.5, 2+3i
    - strings: "hello"
    - Pairs: '(1 . 2)
    - Lists: '(1 2 3 4 5)
    - conventions for identifiers:
        - myProgram vs. my_program vs. my-program (Kebab Case 😄)
        - predicate => suffix "?"


Procedures
    display
        - prints something on console
        - (display "Hello, world!") -> Hello, world!
    = 
        - check equality between numbers
        - (= 5 5) -> #t
        - (= 5 -5) -> #f
    (add1 x), (sub1 x): analogous to (+ x 1) and (- x 1)
    equal?
        - check for equality if arguments are not numbers
        - (equal? "Hello" "He") -> #f
        - (equal? 5 "He") -> #f
    boolean operators: not, and, or
        - (and #t #f) -> #f
        - (not #t) -> #f
    /
        - division between numbers
        - (/ 10 5) -> 2
        - (/ 10.0 7.0) -> 1.4285714285714286
    quotient
        - returns the whole part of the division
        - (quotient 10.0 7.0) -> 1.0
    remainder
        - returns the remainder of the division
        - (remainder 123 10) -> 3
    cond
        - The equivalent of the "switch" case in C++.
        - Used to define guards.
        - Example:
            (define (f x)
				(cond
					[(= x 10) "x is 10"]
					[(even? x) "x is not 10 but is even"]
					[else "x is not 10 and is not even"]
					)
            )

            (f 10) ; -> x is 10
            (f 5) ; -> x is not 10 and is not even
            (f 6) ; -> x is not 10 but is even
    expt
        - the power operator
        - (expt 2 10) -> 1024
    min, max, +, -, *, <, <=, ...
        - NOTE: They work with more than two numbers also!
        - (max 1 2 3 4 5) -> 5
        - (<= 1 2 3 4 5) -> #t
    (if <boolean_cond>  <= Notice the line breaks!
        <code if true>  <= Notice the line breaks!
        <code if false> <= Notice the line breaks!
        )


Key words to watch out for in an exam
    - естествено
    - неотрицателно
    - неположително
    - положително
    - индекс
    - ...


Nested procedures
    - Will more than one procedure use it?
        - Yes => global
        - No => nested


The hello world procedure:

#lang racket    <--- Should always be there

(display "Hello, world!")
^                       ^
|                       |
|                       |
Do not forget the parenthesis (procedure <=> parenthesis) !
