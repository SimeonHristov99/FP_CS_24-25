[X] If you don't have access to Moodle, write me an email as soon as possible: s.e.hristov99@gmail.com .
[X] Walk around the GitHub page.
    [X] What is that "For Home" section? (please remind Simo to explain it at the start of the second hour, in case he forgets!!)
[X] Yes, homework 3 is going to be during the Christmas holidays.
    Here is a timeline that might change:
        - homework 1: 19.10.2024 - 03.11.2024
        - exam 1    : 09/10.11.2024
        - homework 2: 23.11.2024 - 10.12.2024

[X] During the intermission create a chat in Facebook (FP_CS_24_25). Remind Simo if he forgets, please 😄!
    Also keep in mind that if you want a fast/timely reply, you ought to send an email.
    I do not log into FB often.


- !! bracket overflow 😄 !!
- Racket is PREFIX, i.e. first write the procedure and then write its arguments
- extension for Racket files: .rkt
- Edit > Preferences > Editing > Racket > put ticks everywhere
- Edit > Preferences > Editing > General Editing > Enable automatic parenthesis, square brackets, and quotes
- Shortcuts
    - `Cntr + Up-arrow` (or `Esc + p`) for using the previous input in interpreter window
    - `F5` (or `Cntr + F5`) for running the code in the text editor window
    - `Enter` to run code in the interpreter with caret after last character
    - `Cntr + Enter` to run code in the interpreter without caret after last character
    - the two windows are independent, so feel free to test code in the interpreter window even if the code in the text editor window has errors or is incomplete
- IMPORTANT NOTE: DrRacket DOES NOT autosave.

The functions in Racket are (formally) called procedures
    What is the difference between a procedure and a method?
        Methods have the "this" pointer.


What is a predicate?
    A procedure which returns bool.


Types of Evaluation Processes
   Linearly Recursive
        1. The result is stored in a recursive tail.
        2. The recursive call is part of an expression.

   Linearly Iterative
        1. The result is stored as a parameter that is set by ANOTHER function.
        Often the parameter is named "result" and the function - "helper".
        2. The recursive call is not part of an expression.
        These processes are faster than the linearly recursive ones!


What is a declaration and what is a definition?
    int add(const int x, const int y)       <-- declaration
    {                                       <-- definition
        return x + y;                       <-- definition
    }                                       <-- definition


Built-in data types
    - boolean: #t #f
    - numbers: 1, 1.5, 2+3i
    - strings: "hello"
    - Pairs: '(1 . 2)
    - Lists: '(1 2 3 4 5)
    - conventions for identifiers:
        - myProgram vs. my_program vs. my-program (Kebab Case 😄)
        - predicate => suffix "?"


Procedures
    display
        - prints something on console
        - (display "Hello, world!") -> Hello, world!
    = 
        - check equality between numbers
        - (= 5 5) -> #t
        - (= 5 -5) -> #f
    (add1 x), (sub1 x): analogous to (+ x 1) and (- x 1)
    equal?
        - check for equality if arguments are not numbers
        - (equal? "Hello" "He") -> #f
        - (equal? 5 "He") -> #f
    boolean operators: not, and, or
        - (and #t #f) -> #f
        - (not #t) -> #f
    /
        - division between numbers
        - (/ 10 5) -> 2
        - (/ 10.0 7.0) -> 1.4285714285714286
    quotient
        - returns the whole part of the division
        - (quotient 10.0 7.0) -> 1.0
    remainder
        - returns the remainder of the division
        - (remainder 123 10) -> 3
    cond
        - The equivalent of the "switch" case in C++.
        - Used to define guards.
        - Example:
            (define (f x)
				(cond
					[(= x 10) "x is 10"]
					[(even? x) "x is not 10 but is even"]
					[else "x is not 10 and is not even"]
					)
            )

            (f 10) ; -> x is 10
            (f 5) ; -> x is not 10 and is not even
            (f 6) ; -> x is not 10 but is even
    expt
        - the power operator
        - (expt 2 10) -> 1024
    min, max, +, -, *, <, <=, ...
        - NOTE: They work with more than two numbers also!
        - (max 1 2 3 4 5) -> 5
        - (<= 1 2 3 4 5) -> #t
    (if <boolean_cond>  <== Notice the line breaks!
        <code if true>  <== Notice the line breaks!
        <code if false> <== Notice the line breaks!
        )


Key words to watch out for in an exam
    - естествено
    - неотрицателно
    - неположително
    - положително
    - индекс
    - ...


Nested procedures
    - Will more than one procedure use it?
        - Yes => global
        - No => nested


The hello world procedure:

#lang racket    <--- Should always be there

(display "Hello, world!")
^                       ^
|                       |
|                       |
Do not forget the parenthesis (procedure <=> parenthesis) !

# Week_02 - Recursion (part 2)
###################################################################################################

Importing libraries:
    #import ... (in C++) => (require ...) (in Racket)
	(require math/number-theory) ; API: https://docs.racket-lang.org/math/number-theory.html
	(require racket/trace) ; see what arguments a procedure gets when it is called

Procedures:
	(divides? d n): Whether d divides n with remainder=0.
		(divides? 5 25) -> #t ; How would you implement it? Answer: (zero? (reminder n d))
		(divides? 5 19) -> #f
		(divides? 10 66) -> #f
		(divides? 10 100) -> #t
    (divisor-sum n): The sum of the divisors of a number.
        (divisor-sum 6) -> 12 (1 + 2 + 3 + 6)
	(prime? n): Whether n is a prime number.
	(prime-divisors n): Get a list of all the prime divisors of a number.
	(even? n): Whether n is an even number.
	(odd? n): Whether n is an odd number.
	(factorial n): Get the factorial of a number.
	(trace <f-name>): See what calculations happen where. Very useful for debugging!

# Week_03 - Lambda Expressions
###################################################################################################

General
	procedures without a name (anonymous)
		called "arrow functions" in JS, TS, etc (Frontend Languages and Frameworks)
		in 💓 Python3 💓 : lambda x : x + 1
		in    C++        : [](const int x) { return x + 1; } (if interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWgmBBz0y8c)
		in    Racket     : (λ (x) (add1 x))
		in    Haskell    : (\ x -> x + 1)

	have four parts
		brackets
		the lambda symbol ; in DrRacket use Cntr + \ or lambda
		sequence of parameters (separated by SPACE)
		a procedure to be executed over those parameters
	    	(λ (<parameters>) (<procedure>))

	a lambda that adds 5 to a number: (lambda (x) (+ x 5))
		how would a test look like? ((lambda (x) (+ x 5)) 10)

	a lambda-predicate that checks whether a number is greater than 10: (lambda (x) (> x 10))
		how would a test look like? ((lambda (x) (> x 10)) 100)

	a lambda which adds three numbers: (lambda (x y z) (+ x y z))
		how would a test look like? ((lambda (x y z) (+ x y z)) 1 2 3)

	What is an unary procedure? A procedure that takes one argument.
		examples: add1, sub1, prime?, divisor-sum
	
    What is a binary procedure? A procedure that takes two arguments.
		examples: quotient, remainder, expt, divides?

Function Composition
	Composition of f and g over x: f (g x)

Partial Function Application
	1. Take an n-argument procedure f (n > 1).
	2. Apply it to m arguments (m < n).
	3. Return a procedure that takes (n - m) arguments.
	Done! You have just applied f partially to m arguments. The result is a procedure!!
    Currying:
        When you keep applying f only to m=1 arguments until all of them are supplied.

Higher order procedure
	A procedure that accepts at least one procedure as a parameter and/or returns a procedure.
    Procedures can be passed to other procedures just like a normal type (numbers, strings, vectors, arrays, etc.).
        That is why they are called "first class citizens" in JS.

What will the following produce?
	((λ (x y z) (string-append x y z)) "This" " is " "Racket!")
	((λ (x y z) (x y z)) (λ (x y) (+ x y)) 5 6)

Applicative and normal order evaluation
    In applicative order execution, all procedure arguments are evaluated before applying the procedure.
    
    In normal order execution, procedure arguments are evaluated after applying the procedure, and then only if the result is needed to complete the evaluation of the procedure.

    What type of evaluation does C++ have? applicative
    What type of evaluation does Racket have? applicative
    What type of evaluation does Haskell have? normal

# Week_04 - Lists
###################################################################################################

Strings
	API: https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/strings.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._string%29%29
	string-length, string-append, string<?, string=?, string>?, substring str start [end], string-upcase

General
	API: https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html

	the list is a singly linked list

	naming convention:
		Put a suffix 's' at the end of identifiers.
		For example, if we wanted to save '(1 2) in a parameter,
			we would name the it xs
			and read it 'exes' (strangely enough).
		Read the following: ys.

Built-in procedures
	constructing a list
		- (list 1 2 3 4 5 6)
		- '(1 2 3 4 5 6)
		- (cons 1 '()) ; short for construct
		    - (cons 2 (cons 1 '()))
		    - '(1 . (2 . (3 . ())))
		    - if the second parameter is not a list, the result is a pair
                - '(1 . 2)
                - (list? '(1 . 2)) ; #f
                - (pair? '(1 . 2)) ; #t

	check whether a list is empty
		(null? xs)
		(empty? xs)
		(equal? xs '())
		(cons? xs)

	getting the ith element of a list (analog with a train)
		!!! Must have a check to ensure validity of index !!!

		first element (the locomotive ???)
		    (first xs) ; first '(1 2 3) => 1
		    (car xs) ; car '(1 2 3) => 1
		  
		last element
		    (last xs) ; last '(1 2 3) => 3

		second element
		    (second xs) ; second '(1 2 3) => 2

		third, fourth .. tenth

		the ith element
		    (list-ref xs i) ; list-ref '(1 2 3 4) 2 => 3

		get all the wagons of the train
		    (cdr xs) ; cdr '(1 2 3 4 5 6) => '(2 3 4 5 6)'
		    pronounced “could-er"

		CCCC: Car and Cdr Complete Chaos
		    '(1 (2 3 45))
			get 1        : (car '(1 (2 3 45)))
			get '(2 3 45): (cadr '(1 (2 3 45))) ; (second '(1 (2 3 45)))
			get 2        : (caadr '(1 (2 3 45))) ; (car (second '(1 (2 3 45))))

	(length xs) ; find the length (i.e. the number of elements)
		length '("we" 2 "can" 5.26 "have multiple types" #f) => 6
		    Advice: use lists as if they were homogeneous
			        else you won't be able to use some procedures: sort, map, filter, etc.

	(member x xs) ; is an element in a list
	    returns #f => it is not in xs
	    returns a list (the element + everything until the end) => it is in xs
		usually used with (list? )
	    (member 1 '(16 2 3 4)) -> #f
	    (member 1 '(14 2 1 4)) -> (list 1 4)
	    (member 1 '(14 1 2 1 4)) -> (list 1 2 1 4)
		(list? (member 1 '(14 2 1 4))) -> #t
	    (member 1 '(1 2 3 4)) -> '(1 2 3 4)

	(reverse xs) ; reverse the contents of a list
		reverse '(1 2 3) => '(3 2 1)

	(append xs ys ...) ; combine the elements of n lists
		(append '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) '(7 8 9) '(10 11 12) '(13)) => '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13)

	(sort xs p?) ; sort the elements of a list
		p? is a binary predicate
		(sort '(1 3 2) >) => '(3 2 1)

	(flatten xss) ; reduces any sublists to a single list
		(flatten '(1 2 (3 4 5) (6 (7 (8))))) -> '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
		
	(remove-duplicates xs) ; does what its name suggests
		(remove-duplicates '(1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 41 2 3 56)) -> '(1 2 3 4 41 56)

    remove and remove*
        (remq el xs) ; remove the first occurrence of el in xs by going from left to right
            (remq 1 '(2 1 1)) -> '(2 1)
        (remq* ys xs) ; removes all elements in xs from ys
            (remq* '(1) '(1 2 3 1))     -> '(2 3)
            (remq* '(1 2 3) '(1 2 3 1)) -> '()
		remq and remq* use eq? to compare ("shallow check")
			good enough to remove elements from lists with a single dimension / atomic contents.
        remove and remove* use equal? to compare elements ("deep check")
			!! Always use remove and remove* !!
		Examples
			(remq '(1 . 2) '((1 . 2) (4 . 5)))                     ; -> '((1 . 2) (4 . 5))
			(remove '(1 . 2) '((1 . 2) (4 . 5)))                   ; -> '((4 . 5))
			(remq* (list (cons 1 2)) '((1 . 2) (4 . 5) (1 . 2)))   ; -> '((1 . 2) (4 . 5) (1 . 2))
			(remove* (list (cons 1 2)) '((1 . 2) (4 . 5) (1 . 2))) ; -> '((4 . 5))

	(map f xs) ; apply f to every element of xs 
		f must be a unary procedure
		(map (λ (x) (* x 2)) '(1 2 3 4 5)) -> '(2 4 6 8 10)

	(apply f xs) ; apply f to all element of xs
		f must take (length xs) arguments
		(apply + '(1 2 3 4 5)) -> 15

	(filter p? xs) ; return the elements that satisfy p?
		p? has to be unary
		(filter even? '(1 2 3 4 5)) -> '(2 4)
		(filter (λ (x) (divides? 3 x)) '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6)) -> '(0 3 6)
		(filter (curry divides? 3) '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6)) -> '(0 3 6)

	(range x y [step]) ; constructs a list having the elements in the interval [x, y)
		(range 5 10) -> '(5 6 7 8 9)
		(range 5 10 2) -> '(5 7 9)

    (combinations xs [size]) ; construct possible combinations
        (combinations '(1 2 3)) => '(() (1) (2) (1 2) (3) (1 3) (2 3) (1 2 3))
        (combinations '(1 2 3) 2) => '((1 2) (1 3) (2 3))

	foldl, foldr ; reduce a list to a single value
		(fold(r|l) <binary-proc> <init-val> <xs>)
		l => Start from the LEFT side of xs.
		r => Start from the RIGHT side of xs.
		<binary-proc>:
			first parameter is an element from (right side | left side) of xs
			second parameter is called the result / the accumulator / the initial value.
		Examples
            (foldr (λ (x acc) (and x acc)) #f '(#t #t #t #t #t)) -> #f
		    (foldl (λ (x acc) (+ x acc)) 0 '(1 2 3 4 5))         -> 15
		Returns the product of all numbers in the list: '(1 2 3 4 5).
			(foldl (λ (x acc) (* x acc)) 1 '(1 2 3 4 5))
		Find the sum and product of those numbers using another HOF
            product: (apply * '(1 2 3 4 5))
            sum: (apply + '(1 2 3 4 5))

# Week_05 - Pairs. Association Lists
###################################################################################################

Pairs and association lists
	Pairs
		analogy with std::pair<T1, T2>
		'(<value1> . <value2>)

		How to construct?
			(cons 1 2)
			(cons 1 2 3) ; error, because pairs contain only two elements
			(cons "banana" "split") ; -> '("banana" . "split")
			Note: '(1 . 2) is a pair, but '(1 . (2)) is a list

		car = first element; cdr = second element

		can be used to form a list of pairs
			(list '(1 . 2) '(1 . 5) '(5 . 1))

	Associative list (when life gives you lists and pairs, you make an associative list)
		the dict() in Python
		hash maps
			used for making key-value pairs
			a list of pairs where one of the values (typically the first) is unique (has the role of a key)
		(list '(1 . "One") '(2 . "Two") '(3 . "Three"))
		(assoc el xs) ; returns the first PAIR (from left to right) that has "el" as key
					OR #f if there is no such element
			(assoc 1 '((1 . 2) (2 . 3) (1 . 42))) ; -> '(1 . 2)


Higher order functions for lists
	(ormap p? xs) ; returns true if there is at least one element from xs that satisfies p
		(ormap even? '(1 2 3 4 5)) ; -> #t

	(andmap p? xs) ; returns true if all elements from xs satisfy p
		(andmap even? '(1 2 3 4 5))
			What predicate would make it return the opposite result?
				(andmap (lambda (x) (< x 6)) '(1 2 3 4 5))
				(andmap (curry > 6) '(1 2 3 4 5))

	(take xs n) ; return the first n elements in xs
		(take '(1 2 3 4) 0) ; -> null
		(take '(1 2 3 4) 2) ; -> '(1 2)'
		(take '(1 2 3 4) 5) ; -> error

	(takef xs pred?) ; return a list whose elements are taken successively from xs as long as they satisfy pred. The returned list includes up to, but not including, the first element in xs for which pred returns #f.
	(takef '(2 4 5 8) even?) ; -> '(2 4)'
	(takef '(2 4 6 8) odd?)  ; -> null

	(drop xs n) ; remove the first n elements in xs
		(drop '(1 2 3 4) 0) -> '(1 2 3 4)
		(drop '(1 2 3 4) 2) -> '(3 4)
		(drop '(1 2 3 4) 5) -> error

	(dropf xs pred?) ; remove elements in xs as long as they satisfy pred
		(dropf '(2 2 4 8 56) even?) -> null

# Week_07 - Hello, Haskell!
########################################################################################################################

General
	VEEERY whitespace sensitive, i.e. tabs, spaces, new lines matter (a lot)
	comments:
		use -- for single line comments
		use {--} for multiline comments
		only for human-readable text!
	everything is a function here!
		read the following: a = 5 (a :: Int)
		a++, ++a <- invalid 🛑. use (a + 1)
	use camel case to name identifiers, i.e. myFunction
	#include ... (C++) -> import ... (Haskell)
	when passing negative numbers as parameters surround them in brackets
		example: helper (-1)


Types
	1. All types start with a capital letter!
	2. All types must be known at compile time! (strongly typed language; no dynamic casting (polymorphism))
	3. If f returns Int, then f cannot return Double! (statically typed language)

	Bool     -> True False

	Int      -> whole numbers;          uses 32 bits                (ex. 1, 10, 153)
	Integer  -> whole numbers;          unbounded                   (ex. 123456789123456789123456798)

	Float    -> floating-point numbers; equivalent to float in C++  (ex. 1.52)
	Double   -> floating-point numbers; equivalent to double in C++ (ex. 1.5252525252525252525252525252)
	Rational -> floating-point numbers; unbounded

	Char     -> equivalent to char                        in C++ (ex. 'a', '1', 'C', '\n')
	String   -> equivalent to std::string and const char* in C++ (ex. "Haskell")


	Built-in Functions
		boolean logical operators: && || not

		arithmetic
			+, -, * (Only for variables of the same type, i.e. n * m will give an error if n is Int and m - Double)

		division
			for whole numbers
				quotient: div (ex. div 10 5 == 2; div 123 10 == 12)
				remainder: mod (ex. mod 10 5 == 0; mod 123 10 == 3) (equivalent to % in C++)
			real numbers
				use only "/" (equivalent to "/" in C++, but here it cannot be used for whole numbers)

		power
			use n^m  when m is a natural number (i.e. m > 0) (ex. 2^3 == 8)
			use n**m when m is a floating-point number (ex. 2**0.5 == 1.4142135623730951)

		other: min, max, odd, even, gcd, abs, sqrt (sqrt 2 == 1.4142135623730951; sqrt :: Double -> Double)

		❗❗❗ Int => Double: fromIntegral           (ex. if x is 5, then (fromIntegral x) is 5.0)  ❗❗❗
		❗❗❗ Double => Int: ceiling, floor, round, truncate  (ex. round 5.45 == 5)                ❗❗❗
		❗❗❗ != (C++) => /= (Haskell)              (ex. 5 /= 5 is False; True /= False is True)   ❗❗❗


	The "Hello world" function:

		($) - read this function as "after"; accepts a function as a left parameter and an expression as a right side.

# Week_08 - Lists and Tuples
########################################################################################################################


	Tuples (Vectors) (Ordered pairs)

		- data structures whose size has to be explicitly stated (analogy with array in C++)
		- can hold multiple types (ex. x :: (Int, String, [Double]) is a vector with 3 dimensions)
		- fst (5, 6) => 5
		- snd (5, 6) => 6

		Examples:
		a vector with two coordinates representing a point in 2D space:
		type Point2D = (Int, Int)
		-- typedef std::pair<int, int> Point2D;

		Now every function that accepts a Point2D will look like this:

		helper :: Point2D -> Int -- instead of (Int, Int) -> Int
		helper (x, y) = x + y -- this function sums up the coordinates. Notice the pattern matching!
		-- helper x = fst x + snd x

		Notice:
		type String = [Char]


	Typeclasses

		This is the analog of using "template <class T>" in C++.

		Example:
			Let's say that a function should accept numbers in general, not only Int or Double.

			old:
			helper :: Int -> Int

			new:
			helper :: (Num a, Num b) => a -> b

		Some useful Typeclasses
			if only numbers then Num
			if ==, /= then Eq
			if <, <=, >=, > then Ord
			if only Float and Double then Fractional
			if only Int and Integer then Integral
			if making an algebraic type that has to be printed then Show

		In most cases the compiler will help us (Compiler Driven Development). We'll demonstrate how this works today!

		Detailed example and workflow:
			A function that adds 1 to every number in a list:
				If we were working with whole numbers it would be:
					addOne :: [Int] -> [Int]
					addOne xs = map (\ x -> x + 1) xs
				When working with typeclasses we're abstracting away the whole numbers concept - we're now working with anything that is a number.
				You might start with:
					addOne :: [a] -> [a]
					addOne xs = map (\ x -> x + 1) xs
				But this will throw an error because "a" is not bound/restricted - as written above it can be any type, including "Char", "String", even "[String]" and functions.
				And we know that "+" is not defined for types different from "Num". This is why if we run the above code we'll get an error:
					• No instance for (Num a) arising from a use of ‘+’
					Possible fix:
						add (Num a) to the context of
						the type signature for:
							addOne :: forall a. [a] -> [a]
					• In the expression: x + 1
					In the first argument of ‘map’, namely ‘(\ x -> x + 1)’
					In the expression: map (\ x -> x + 1) xs
				However! Look at what the compiler is saying:
					add (Num a) to the context of [...] addOne
				This is the key to compiler driven development! The compiler helps us define the proper types by suggesting the restriction that we need to place.
				We do that and now the following function works:
					addOne :: (Num a) => [a] -> [a]
					addOne xs = map (\ x -> x + 1) xs

			The approach I suggest is therefore the following:
				1. Write our the declaration skipping the typeclasses (addOne :: [a] -> [a]).
				2. Try to run the script. It will fail with errors that help you (add (Num a) to the context of [...] addOne).
				3. Fix the declarations from the first to the last (i.e. by going from top to bottom in the error messages) by adding the typeclasses.
				4. If you cannot fix the declarations and the task does not require them, remove all declarations. The code will still work because Haskell has built-in type inference.

		A note about the "read" function:
			We know that we can use read to transform a string into a number.
			Let's say we define the following function without a declaration:
				f ss = read ss
			And call it like: f "16" and f "15.42".
			What is the problem here?
				We can't define "f" without a declaration because Haskell has to know what type we want to return from every call.
					The first call suggests "Int", but the second one suggests "Double".
			So, remember: when using "read" always specify return type explicitly.

	# Let Syntax
	###################################################################################################

	Description:
		A nested, lexically-scoped, mutually-recursive list of declarations (let is often called `letrec` in other languages). The scope of the declarations is the expression and the right hand side of the declarations.

	Examples:

	aaa = let y = 1+2
			  z = 4+6
			  in  y+z

    aaa x y = let r = 3 
                  s = 6
                  in  r*x + s*y

	aaa vector = let (x, y) = vector in x + y

# Week_10 - Algebraic Types. Nonlinear Data Structures
###################################################################################################

Algebraic Data Types:

   the analog of class and struct in C++
      can also be used as enumerations
   three parts: name, types (optional), constructors
   the name of the constructors may not match the name of the data type

Syntax: data <name> [<types>] = <constructors>

-- enumeration
data Weather = Hot | Cold

You would use this as follows:
   f :: Weather -> Int
   f Hot = 42
   f Cold = -42

-- new type called "Shape"
-- it can be used to create figures with different number of parameters
-- in this case: radius for a circle and length of sides for a triangle
Non-polymorphic: data Shape = Circle Int | Triangle Int Int Int
Polymorphic: data Shape a = Circle a | Triangle a a a

Note: In order to have the ability to print a shape, we must tell Haskell to redefine the output operator.
This happens like so:

data Shape a = Circle a | Triangle a a a
 deriving (Show)
